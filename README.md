# Traffic Light State Machine

A state machine in VHDL that controls 2 7-segment displays, each representing a set of traffic lights in the north-south and east-west directions.

It was the 4th lab project in the ECE 124 Digital Circuits & Systems course. We worked on all the files in this repository, except `segment7_mux.vhd` and `clock_generator.vhd`.

## How it works

The lights go through 16 states and are controlled by a Moore-type finite state machine. 

## Remaining problems

- The state machine is clocked by the clock enable signal generated by the clock generator structure, not the universal 50 MHz clock.
- The code is messy and poorly commented.
